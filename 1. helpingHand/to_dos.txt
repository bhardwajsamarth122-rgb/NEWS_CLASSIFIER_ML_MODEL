🪜 STEP-BY-STEP DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP
🔹 STEP 1: Data Understanding (Notebook)

Notebook: 01_data_understanding.ipynb

Focus:

Dataset size

Category distribution

Missing values

Text length analysis

Key questions:

Class imbalance?

Headline vs description importance?

🔹 STEP 2: Data Cleaning & Preparation

Notebook: 02_data_cleaning.ipynb

Actions:

Merge text features:

headline + short_description

Remove:

HTML

URLs

Punctuation

Stopwords

Lowercasing

Output:

data/processed/train.csv
data/processed/test.csv
data/processed/val.csv


💡 Keep labels untouched.

🔹 STEP 3: Feature Engineering

Notebook: 03_feature_engineering.ipynb

Industry standard options:

TF-IDF (baseline)

Count Vectorizer (fast)

Word embeddings (optional later)

Output:

Save vectorizer in:

data/features/vectorizer.pkl


⚠️ Never retrain vectorizer during inference.

🔹 STEP 4: Model Experimentation

Notebook: 04_model_experiments.ipynb

Try:

Logistic Regression (baseline)

Multinomial Naive Bayes

Linear SVM

Evaluation:

Accuracy

F1-score (macro)

Confusion matrix

Select best model.

🔹 STEP 5: Production Training Pipeline

Script: src/models/train.py

Responsibilities:

Load processed data

Load vectorizer

Train model

Save model to:

artifacts/models/news_classifier.pkl


📌 No notebooks here.

🔹 STEP 6: Model Evaluation

Script: src/models/evaluate.py

Output:

Classification report

Store metrics in:

artifacts/reports/metrics.json

🔹 STEP 7: Prediction Pipeline

Script: src/models/predict.py

Input:

Raw text (headline + description)

Output:

Predicted category

This is the core business logic.

🔹 STEP 8: API / Deployment Ready

File: app/main.py

Expose:

POST /predict


Payload:

{
  "headline": "...",
  "short_description": "..."
}


Response:

{
  "category": "POLITICS"
}

📌 IMPORTANT INDUSTRY PRACTICES

✅ Keep notebooks only for experiments
✅ Move logic into src/
✅ Save vectorizers & models
✅ Use config files
✅ Version datasets
✅ Never hard-code paths
