"weekend roundup: one year on, the worldpost has 28 million monthly views the worldpost was launched one year ago in davos. it was born out of a contradiction and a paradox. 

the contradiction is that while the world is growing more interdependent, the media is fragmenting -- re-nationalizing, re-localizing and even tribalizing. the resulting paradox is that the information age is becoming the age of non-communication across boundaries -- political, cultural and ideological.

the aim of the worldpost is to help bridge this growing chasm by becoming a platform where the whole world meets; a common zone where cross-pollination of ideas and perspectives from all corners of the planet can take place.

to achieve this aim, the worldpost strives for a global viewpoint looking around, not a national perspective looking out. along with intelligent curation of the global news and original reportage, what distinguishes us, above all, are the first person global voices of our contributors. every week, they weigh in as events break from havana to beijing, from moscow to mexico city, paris, new delhi and abuja among so many other places.
